This is the CLI version of Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Sadly it doesn't include fancy graphics since I am new to programming !
Some of the Commands of the game are as follows != 

1. 1 stands for Stone

2. 2 stands for Paper 

3. 3 Stands for Scissors

The mechanics of the Game is very simple. Here in brief --> Firstly the input is being taken and then using if-else loop it prints

what you entered basically its convert the numerical value into characters. Then using the random library the cpu also generates some

random numbers between 1 and 3 and then using this numbers I used again a if-else loop to match and the results and declare where

the gamers win or lose it.

Hope you understand the Mechanics !
